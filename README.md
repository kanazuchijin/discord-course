Welcome to Business App Development.

## Communication and Announcements
The primary means of communication for this course will be on our Discord server. This is the central location for all things related to this course. This includes announcements, discussion groups, community news, assignment discussions, and various other topics.

Announcements and important updates will be pushed through Discord and Moodle Announcements. For Moodle, ensure your notification settings allow you to receive notifications. 

If you would like a quick response, contact me or the TA on Discord. For a slower response, please email us. If you would like a more private space to speak with me, you are welcome to send a private message on Discord, an email, or schedule an appointment to meet in my office.

### Instructor Response
The instructor will respond to student communication, Monday through Friday; if Saturday or Sunday, I will not check email, so please use Discord. For basic questions concerning homework, grading, and other similar things please message the TA. 

If you do use email, please include `BMIS 365` in your email subject line for a quicker response.

## Course Information and Prerequisites
This course is offered for a traditional letter grade for 3 credit hours per semester. This course does not have any official prerequisites other than Junior standing in Business. However, it would be beneficial for you to have a basic understanding of data types (e.g., integers, characters, boolean). This is important in understanding the data that influences every aspect of programming. I assume no prior knowledge or skills, though.

## Course Value
As a developer, you transform manual processes into a digital realm. Programming utilizes technology, expertise, knowledge, logic, and creative thinking to find solutions to problems. This course will provide you with the tools and experience to familiarize and acquaint yourself with programming. More specifically, you will develop an understanding of foundational concepts for logical processing.

## Textbook and Computer Requirements
This course does not use a textbook. If you would like a textbook, a good option is this textbook: [The C# Player's Guide (3rd Edition) 9780985580131](https://www.amazon.com/C-Players-Guide-3rd/dp/0985580135).

Computer Requirements
* Reliable, high-speed broadband Internet connection
* Intel Core i5 Processor (Core i7 best)
* 16 GB RAM *minimum*
* Windows 10, latest update; or Windows 11, latest update
* Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, or Google Chrome

## Applications and Packages
During the semester you will be using the programming language C# to enable you to conduct a wide variety of work. My examples and tutorials are performed in Visual Studio Code. You are welcome to use alternatives, but I will most likely *not* be able to assist you with app-specific problems. For example, if you use Eclipse or NetBeans, I cannot assist you if you encounter app-specific issues.

Prior to installing any of these applications, setup your GitHub account first. Setup requires you to use your GitHub account.

In this course your homework and code will be managed using GitHub. A nice, visual application for managing your GitHub repositories is the GitHub Desktop application. This is the easiest tool to use for managing your repositories. Please install this on your computer. It is available for Windows, Linux, and Mac. __*This is required.*__
* GitHub Desktop [https://desktop.github.com/](https://desktop.github.com/)

You will use Visual Studio Code as your interactive development environment (IDE). __*This is required.*__ To install Visual Studio Code, please read these instructions:
* [Visual Studio Code Setup and Install](vscode-setup.md).

Please note, all my tutorials are in Windows or Linux. The software will work on Mac and ample tutorials are available online if you search for it. You will receive the best help for Windows and Linux because the majority of the programming community exists on those platforms and that is what I am familiar with. If you use Mac, I will not be able to provide Mac-specific help as I have never used Mac, nor am I familiar with it. You will find help online through StackExchange and similar websites.

The last application to install is the Discord client. It is available on Windows, Linux, Mac, Android, and iOS. I recommend installing on both your computer and your mobile device. For installation instructions, setting up notifications (important for receiving announcements and updates), and general usage, please follow these instructions:
* [Discord Setup and Installation](discord-setup.md)

## Grading Criteria and Required Work
| Grading criteria | Percent |
|:---|:---|
| ICE | 15% |
| THA | 35% |
| Project | 45% |
| Professionalism | 5% |

<!--#### Quizzes
Quizzes will be made available at the start of each class period and end exactly 10 minutes after. This is aimed at assessing the knowledge and skills learned for a given week. You are allowed to miss one quiz during the semester. If you have a University excused absence, you may take a different version of a quiz on a different day. Notice must be given prior to class. Any notice given after or during the quiz, except for an emergency, will not qualify as an excuse. If you are allowed a make-up, it will be in a different form/version from that given to the class.
-->
#### Submitting Work Using Markdown
In this course you will submit your work using markdown for GitHub. While most courses traditionally rely on Word or PDF, those are pre-internet formats and are not ideal for an internet-first, digital world. You will learn more about this in one of your first assignments.

GitHub provides a neat reference: [Basic writing and syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax). Please bookmark this on your browser.

#### Integrative Class Exercises (ICE)
These assignments are designed to integrate the knowledge of specific mechanics of C#. They are meant to encourage learning and understanding of the concepts covered. As the purpose is to provide a learning experience, students receive full credit for attempting the assignment. That is, wrong answers are not penalized. Where can you lose points? If you do not attempt a part of the ICE, you will lose points for that portion. You are allowed to seek help from fellow classmates and work on these with each other if you desire.

Your ICE is due at the end of the class period. The instructor or TA will review your completed assignment and mark it as complete. This requires you to come prepared to class having read all of the material. You are more than welcome to start working on the ICE prior to class. You can even come to class having written all of the code beforehand!

#### Take-Home Assignments (THA)
Individually assigned, these take-home assignments focus more on concepts, rather than specific mechanics. You must submit your typed, well-organized write-up electronically via GitHub on the stated due date. The homework assignments are to be solved individually. This means that you are not to solve problems with other classmates or compare answers prior to turning in the work. Cooperative efforts on individual work will result in an immediate score of zero for all parties involved; the individuals will then be submitted for an academic violation. These assignments are more complex and require more time than ICEs.

<!--#### Examinations
You will have two exams during the semester to assess your knowledge. The exams will have problems/questions. They can include the following types of questions: matching, multiple choice, multiple select, fill-in-the-blank, and/or short answer problems. I will give additional guidance on exam content ahead of time. I will give clear instructions on permissible materials that you may use. The exams will be administered through Moodle. You must take exams on the designated days and times. Generally, the exam time is the same time as scheduled class sessions.
-->
#### Project
You will work on a class project involving development of a business solution. Specifics about acceptable business problems, which you will be identifying, analyzing and solving, will be given later in the semester. You will be responsible for identifying, conceptualizing, designing and developing a valuable solution to a real-world business problem. You can work on it in a team of 2 students. Each team will submit two deliverables (documenting each and every step of their development effort) via GitHub. Generally, (unless a compelling argument is given to suggest otherwise) the term project will involve a business problem of your choice.
* The first deliverable is worth 40% of your project score
* The second deliverable is worth 40% of your project score
* The presentation is worth 20%

For further instructions, guidelines, and expectations of the project, please read the following:
* [Project Overview](project-overview.md)
* [Project Deliverable 1](project-del1.md)
* [Project Deliverable 2](project-del2.md)
* [Project Presentation](project-present.md)

#### Late Submission of Assignments
Assignments will be accepted up to one week after the due date. For each day late, 10% will be deducted from the final score. For example, if a student submits a late assignment five days past the due date/time and scores a perfect 10 out of 10 points, the final score will be 5 out of 10. This is because the assignment is 5 days past due, which is a reduction of 50% of the final score. If a student earns 5 out of 10 points, then the final grading will earn 2.5 out of 10.

#### Professionalism
As in all business courses, students are expected to act professionally inside and outside of the classroom. To facilitate and develop these attributes you will be assessed by the following:

1. *Appropriate Use of Help*. When requesting help from the professor, you are expected to have read the background material and have made a reasonable effort to solve the problem beforehand. It is important that you exercise your ability to think and problem-solve before asking for help. Asking for help when you have not made a sincere effort to complete the problem or assignment is not acceptable.
2. *Classroom Conduct*. In order to maintain a professional atmosphere in the classroom, students should do the following:
    * Arrive early so that class can start on time.  Late attendance is disruptive, unprofessional, and will negatively affect your grade.
    * Be prepared to participate—refusing to participate in the discussion shows you are not prepared.
    * Do not read newspapers, browse the web, play games, text, or engage in private conversations during lectures and presentations.
3. *Courteous Behavior*. Professionalism includes treating the professor and other class members with courtesy and respect. Examples of discourteous behavior include—but are not limited to—dominating class discussion time, groveling for points, and demeaning someone else’s comments.

#### Grade Disputes
If you feel an assessment has been graded unfairly or if you feel you have a better solution, write up your dispute and send it to me via Discord, email, or in writing to my office; do not leave your dispute under the office door, outside the door, or any place in which it can potentially be lost. You must dispute a grade within one week of grading.

#### Academic Integrity
You are to do your own work where specified.  Do NOT use "helpers" which means friends, family, coworkers; do them completely on your own. You are welcome to use online resources (e.g., Stack Exchange, Chat GPT) requesting clarification, but they are not allowed to do all of the work. Doing it with someone else or having a "coach" or having someone else do it for you constitutes CHEATING and can result in an "F" for a course grade. _If you decide to rely on ChatGPT, Bing, or similar tools, you must include the transcript of your "conversation" with the tool._

You can talk with other students on your assignments and project where it is allowed (see ICE above). Do NOT copy part or all of anyone else's assignment; and do NOT allow another to copy part or all of yours. This will result in an F for a course grade.

The University of Montana has a policy on academic integrity. You are expected to abide by this policy in this class. All students must practice academic honesty.  Academic misconduct is subject to an academic penalty by the course instructor and/or a disciplinary sanction by the University.  The University of Montana Student Conduct Code specifies definitions and adjudication processes for academic misconduct and states, “Students at the University of Montana are expected to practice academic honesty at all times.” (Section V.A., available at [http://www.umt.edu/student-affairs/dean-of-students/default.php](http://www.umt.edu/student-affairs/dean-of-students/default.php)).  All students need to be familiar with the Student Conduct Code. It is the student’s responsibility to be familiar the Student Conduct Code. Please also see [COB Code of Professional Conduct](http://www.business.umt.edu/ethics/professional-conduct-code.php).

#### Accommodations for Students with Disabilities
If you require testing or homework accommodations as certified by the Office for Disability Equity, then please inform me in writing. If you need any type of accommodation, *please ensure the Office for Disability Equity has sent me the appropriate documentation*. Students are responsible for requesting accommodations. You must submit a written request for any accommodation to me at least five school days before the date you require it. Please schedule a meeting with me in my office to discuss arrangements. For more information, please go to [https://www.umt.edu/disability/](https://www.umt.edu/disability/).

#### Diversity Equity Inclusion Statement
Consistent with UM's [Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Plan](https://www.umt.edu/diversity-equity-inclusion-plan/), I aim to include the representation of different identities, characteristics, experiences, and perspectives of all students. I strive to create a welcoming environment in which differences are celebrated and everyone is valued, respected, and able to reach their full potential. If you feel your voice is not heard in class (or outside) please see me or the TA.
